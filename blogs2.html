            <br>
             It's obvious, you run. When you run, you are going to need a lot of energy to the muscles of your body.
            <br>
            <br>
            1. This happens by a hormone called cortisol, this helps in transporting glucose/energy to the muscles ---
            meaning your sugar level rises.
            <br><br>
            2. This glucose is transported through blood and this needs to be rushed to your muscles real fast. This
            leads to increasing the pressure of your blood through your blood vessels --- your BP rises.
            <br><br>
            3. The blood pressure is increased by 'constricting/shrinking' your arteries so that the blood travels
            faster. Our blood vessels at times have fats and dirt deposited in them, and when this shrinking occurs, the
            arteries can get blocked -- leading to heart attacks.
            <br><br>
            <br>
            Do you think you are going to feel hungry or any other emotion when there is a lion in front of you?
            <br><br>
            No, right? This is because there are two types of nervous systems in the body. They are the Parasympathetic
            (System A) and Sympathetic Nervous System (System B).
            <br><br>
            1. System A works when you are at rest, digestion process takes place, excretion process, body healing,
            etc.,
            <br><br>
            2. System B becomes active when you're facing a threat/emergency. (Releasing of cortisol and adrenaline)
            <br><br>
            (Note: Both the systems (A&B) work autonomously)
            <br><br>
            ONLY one system works at a time. And that is why you are not going to feel any other emotion when you are in
            a threat situation.
            <br><br>
            Now replace the lion with stress/tension. That's the same flow of hormones which occur inside the body
            during both the situations.
            <br><br>
            <br>
            The problem doesn't stop here, it aggravates further.
            <br><br>
            Excess cortisol causes excess sugar to become fat deposits in unwanted places in the body (leading to
            obesity), can even lead to over-eating (due to excess energy in the body tricking your mind into thinking
            you are hungry when you are not), can affect your circadian rhythm (sleep-wake-cycle), destroy the general
            adaptive routine of the body.
            <br><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Note: This is just a brief explanation of the processes involved in the human body during stress/tension as
            simple as possible, might have left some medical terms out!
            <br><br>
            The first step is always to understand what and how our body functions and the next step is to combat it.
            Will post a series of articles soon on how to combat stress soon!
