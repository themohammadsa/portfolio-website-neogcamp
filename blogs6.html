        <h1>My work-flow on Notion: the ultimate productivity hack!</h1>
        <p class="padding-blogs"><small>Dec 2, 2020</small></p>

        <p class="padding-blogs">
            <br>
            
            This entire blog focuses on the WHY’s of my work-flow and not on the HOW’s and WHAT’s.<br><br>
            Been wondering for a while on what’s the greatest tool to improvise my work productivity, and alas – I have found the ultimate tool to hack productivity!
            <br><br>But before jumping in, let me just give a short description of what notion is. Notion is an “all-in-one workspace” where you can “write, plan, collaborate, and get organized.” So Notion’s website says. And it’s true. It’s powerful. 
            <br><br>You could read more about notion, what it does, how it works and what not – online, there’s ton’s of tutorials on them. I don’t want to bore you with the details of all that. 
            <br><br>Let me jump into how I have personalized notion for myself. I promise to try my best to make it entertaining, haha! 
            <br><br><strong>Here’s a preview of the front-page of my notion.</strong>
            <br><br> <img src="/images/blogs6/1.jpg" class="container-center-blogs-image" >  <br><br>
            Most of the stuff under the categories are self-explanatory. So, let me jump forward into showing you previews of individual pages. The best part of notion is the board section which gives you access to a Kanban board - it’s crazy on how much you can accomplish with Kanban, in fact Trello’s workspace is completely Kanban.
            <br><br><strong>Preview – To Do:</strong>
            <br><br> <img src="/images/blogs6/2.jpg" class="container-center-blogs-image" >  <br><br>
            Don’t be alarmed, the label under this preview is at ‘All Tasks – Board’. So, I have split my work-flow into different sections based on the work that I do. I can click into individual sections and view the work under them. (You can read about the how’s & what’s of this online) 
            <br><br><strong>Preview – Habit Tracker:</strong>
            <br><br> <img src="/images/blogs6/3.jpg" class="container-center-blogs-image" >  <br><br>
            Habit Tracker is something that I enjoy filling everyday, as in the bottom I have the ‘Checked’ section which displays the number – and this is honestly great as it will be able to motivate me to do better each month. (hopefully, hehe.)
            <br><br>Some hacks that I have used for creating the dates is to, copy-paste the dates from excel. As auto-filling of dates is not possible in notion (up-to my knowledge, if you know so – please do tell me). 
            <br><br><strong>Preview – Web Dev Notes:</strong> 
            <br><br> <img src="/images/blogs6/4.jpg" class="container-center-blogs-image" >  <br><br>
            This is something that I really like a lot, I can just create a table under ‘usefull CSS Code’ and type the code on the left and what it means on the right. It’s really efficient. Some background into my previous efforts are – I used to save all these stuffs in a notepad format, or send it to my friend on whatsapp, so that the content is saved. But it gets really confusing as you don’t know where you saved what.  
            <br><br><strong>Preview – Recipes:</strong> 
            <br><br> <img src="/images/blogs6/5.jpg" class="container-center-blogs-image" >  <br><br>


            This one’s a life-saviour (atleast for my use, hehe!) I love cooking, and I love to explore lot of new recipes. I miss the recipes always, and I really needed something concrete to save all those mouth-watering recipes. Living with two roomies, it’s easier to just send them the screenshot of the ingredients list and they purchase it for me (I don’t go out to buy stuffs – it’s kinda the bargain I did ‘coz I am the cheff, haha!) <br><br>
            I have to be honest here, I am still formulating the entire work-flow with tweaks and updates as I have just begun doing so. It takes time to build your work-flow. <br><br> But trust me, it’s worth every cent of your time – in the longer run, atleast.  <br><br>  <br><br>
            Do reach out to me <strong> @themohammadsa </strong> on Twitter and tell me your tips on how I can improvise!  <br><br>
